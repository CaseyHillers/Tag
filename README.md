## Setup

You will need a Firebase project set up, with Authentication->Google enabled

### Fingerprint

For development, Firebase uses an approved list of fingerprints before allowing use
of the project. To do this, [read this Medium article to get your SHA1 fingerprint](https://medium.com/pen-bold-kiln-press/sha-1-android-studio-ec02fb893e72),
then add it to the list (found under firebase project -> settings -> general -> android app -> add fingerprint).
